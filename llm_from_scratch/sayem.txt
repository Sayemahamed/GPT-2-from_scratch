Hello! I'm Iftaker, a 7th-semester Computer Science student at International Islamic University Chittagong (IIUC), passionate about exploring the operations side of Large Language Models (LLMs). My work spans programming language development, such as Bangla Lang 2.0, and advanced AI applications like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Iâ€™ve contributed to projects like DocuBuddy, leveraging technologies like LangChain and FAISS for efficient document management. Beyond academics, I thrive in hackathons, with highlights including NASA's Space App Challenge and the GalacticImpactNeoVisualization project. I'm always eager to collaborate on AI and operations-driven innovations.
